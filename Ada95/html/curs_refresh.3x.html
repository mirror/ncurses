<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>refresh</STRONG> and <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>  routines  (or  <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG>)  must be called to get actual output to the ter-
       minal, as other routines  merely  manipulate  data  struc-
       tures.   The  routine  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> copies the named window to
       the physical terminal screen, taking into account what  is
       already  there  in order to do optimizations.  The <STRONG>refresh</STRONG>
       routine is the same, using <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> as the  default  window.
       Unless  <STRONG>leaveok</STRONG>  has  been enabled, the physical cursor of
       the terminal is left at the location  of  the  cursor  for
       that window.

       The  <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG>  routines  allow multiple
       updates with more  efficiency  than  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>  alone.   In
       addition  to  all  the window structures, <STRONG>curses</STRONG> keeps two
       data structures representing the terminal screen: a physi-
       cal screen, describing what is actually on the screen, and
       a virtual screen, describing what the programmer wants  to
       have on the screen.

       The  routine <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> works by first calling <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG>,
       which copies the named window to the virtual  screen,  and
       then  calling  <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG>, which compares the virtual screen
       to the physical screen and does the actual update.  If the
       programmer  wishes  to  output  several windows at once, a
       series of calls to <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> results in  alternating  calls
       to  <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG>, causing several bursts of
       output to the screen.  By first calling  <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG>  for
       each  window,  it  is then possible to call <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG> once,
       resulting in only one burst of output,  with  fewer  total
       characters transmitted and less CPU time used.  If the <EM>win</EM>
       argument to <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> is the global  variable  <STRONG>curscr</STRONG>,  the
       screen  is immediately cleared and repainted from scratch.

       The phrase "copies the named window to the virtual screen"
       above  is  ambiguous.   What  actually happens is that all
       <EM>touched</EM> (changed) lines in the window are  copied  to  the
       virtual  screen.   This affects programs that use overlap-
       ping windows; it means that if two  windows  overlap,  you
       see  the  section on <STRONG>PORTABILITY</STRONG> below for a warning about
       exploiting this behavior.)

       The <STRONG>wredrawln</STRONG> routine indicates to <STRONG>curses</STRONG> that some screen
       lines  are corrupted and should be thrown away before any-
       thing is written over  them.   It  touches  the  indicated
       lines  (marking  them  changed).   The routine <STRONG>redrawwin</STRONG>()
       touches the entire window.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Routines that return an integer return <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  upon  failure,
       and  <STRONG>OK</STRONG>  (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than
       <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful completion.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note that <STRONG>refresh</STRONG> and <STRONG>redrawwin</STRONG> may be macros.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue  4  describes  these  func-
       tions.

       Whether  <STRONG>wnoutrefresh()</STRONG>  copies  to the virtual screen the
       entire contents of a window or just its  changed  portions
       has never been well-documented in historic curses versions
       (including SVr4).  It might be unwise to  rely  on  either
       behavior  in  programs  that  might have to be linked with
       other curses implementations.   Instead,  you  can  do  an
       explicit  <STRONG>touchwin()</STRONG>  before  the  <STRONG>wnoutrefresh()</STRONG>  call to
       guarantee an entire-contents copy anywhere.
