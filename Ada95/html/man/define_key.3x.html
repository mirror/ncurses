<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to define keycodes  with  their  corresponding
       control  strings,  so that the ncurses library will inter-
       pret them just as it would the  predefined  codes  in  the
       terminfo database.

       If  the  given string is null, any existing definition for
       the keycode is removed.  Similarly, if the  given  keycode
       is  negative  or  zero,  any existing string for the given
       definition is removed.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       The keycode  must  be  greater  than  zero,  else  ERR  is
       returned.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These  routines  are  specific  to ncurses.  They were not
       supported on Version 7, BSD or System  V  implementations.
       It  is recommended that any code depending on them be con-
       ditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
