<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These  functions provide an interface to mouse events from
       <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG>.  Mouse events are  represented  by  <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>
       pseudo-key values in the <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> input stream.

       To  make mouse events visible, use the <STRONG>mousemask</STRONG> function.
       This will  set  the  mouse  events  to  be  reported.   By
       default,  no mouse events are reported.  The function will
       return a mask to indicate which  of  the  specified  mouse
       events  can be reported; on complete failure it returns 0.
       If oldmask is non-NULL, this function fills the  indicated
       location  with  the  previous  value of the given window's
       mouse event mask.

       As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask  may  turn  off
       the  mouse pointer; setting a nonzero mask may turn it on.
       Whether this happens is device-dependent.

       Here are the mouse event type masks:

       l l _ _ l l.   <EM>Name</EM> <EM>Description</EM>  BUTTON1_PRESSED     mouse
       button   1  down  BUTTON1_RELEASED    mouse  button  1  up
       BUTTON1_CLICKED     mouse      button      1       clicked
       BUTTON1_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  1  double  clicked
       BUTTON1_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  1  triple  clicked
       BUTTON2_PRESSED     mouse        button       2       down
       BUTTON2_RELEASED    mouse        button        2        up
       BUTTON2_CLICKED     mouse       button      2      clicked
       BUTTON2_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  2  double  clicked

       BUTTON3_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  3  double  clicked
       BUTTON3_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  3  triple  clicked
       BUTTON4_PRESSED     mouse        button       4       down
       BUTTON4_RELEASED    mouse        button        4        up
       BUTTON4_CLICKED     mouse       button      4      clicked
       BUTTON4_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  4  double  clicked
       BUTTON4_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  4  triple  clicked
       BUTTON_SHIFT   shift was down during button  state  change
       BUTTON_CTRL    control was down during button state change
       BUTTON_ALT     alt was down  during  button  state  change
       ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS    report   all   button   state  changes
       REPORT_MOUSE_POSITION    report mouse movement

       Once a class of mouse events have been made visible  in  a
       window,  calling  the  <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>  function on that window may
       return <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG> as an indicator that a  mouse  event  has
       been queued.  To read the event data and pop the event off
       the queue, call <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>.  This function will return <STRONG>OK</STRONG> if
       a mouse event is actually visible in the given window, <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>
       otherwise.  When <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG> returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG>, the  data  deposited
       as  y  and  x  in  the event structure coordinates will be
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates.  The  returned
       state  mask  will have exactly one bit set to indicate the
       event type.

       The <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG> function behaves  analogously  to  <STRONG>ungetch</STRONG>.
       It  pushes  a  <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>  event  onto the input queue, and
       associates with  that  event  the  given  state  data  and
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates.

       The  <STRONG>wenclose</STRONG>  function  tests  whether  a  given  pair of
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates is enclosed  by
       a  given  window, returning TRUE if it is and FALSE other-
       wise.  It is useful for determining  what  subset  of  the
       screen windows enclose the location of a mouse event.

       The <STRONG>wmouse_trafo</STRONG> function transforms a given pair of coor-
       dinates from stdscr-relative coordinates  to  screen-rela-
       tive  coordinates  or  vice  versa.  Please remember, that
       stdscr-relative coordinates are not  always  identical  to
       screen-relative   coordinates  due  to  the  mechanism  to
       reserve lines on top or bottom of  the  screen  for  other
       purposes  (ripoff() call, see also slk_...  functions). If
       the parameter <STRONG>to_screen</STRONG> is <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>, the pointers <STRONG>pY,</STRONG> <STRONG>pX</STRONG>  must
       reference  the coordinates of a location inside the window
       <STRONG>win</STRONG>. They are converted to screen-relative coordinates and
       returned  through the pointers. If the conversion was suc-
       cessful, the function returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>. If one of the  parame-
       ters  was  NULL  or the location is not inside the window,
       <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> is returned. If <STRONG>to_screen</STRONG> is <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>, the pointers <STRONG>pY,</STRONG>
       encloses  this  point.  In  this case the function returns
       <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>. If one of the parameters is NULL or the point is not
       inside  the window, <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> is returned. Please notice, that
       the referenced coordinates are only replaced by  the  con-
       verted coordinates if the transformation was successful.

       The <STRONG>mouseinterval</STRONG> function sets the maximum time (in thou-
       sands of a second)  that  can  elapse  between  press  and
       release  events  in  order  for them to be recognized as a
       click.  This function returns the previous interval value.
       The default is one fifth of a second.

       Note  that  mouse  events will be ignored when input is in
       cooked mode, and will cause an error beep when cooked mode
       is  being simulated in a window by a function such as <STRONG>get-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>str</STRONG> that expects a linefeed for input-loop termination.



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>, <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG> and <STRONG>mouseinterval</STRONG> return the  integer
       <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  upon failure or <STRONG>OK</STRONG> upon successful completion. <STRONG>mouse-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>mask</STRONG> returns the mask of reportable events.  <STRONG>wenclose</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>wmouse_trafo</STRONG> are boolean functions returning <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> or <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>
       depending on their test result.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These calls were designed for  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG>,  and  are  not
       found in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous
       version of curses.

       The feature macro <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION</STRONG> is provided so the
       preprocessor  can  be  used to test whether these features
       are present (its value is 1).   NOTE:  THIS  INTERFACE  IS
       EXPERIMENTAL  AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE!  If
       the interface is changed, the value of  <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VER-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>SION</STRONG> will be incremented.

       The  order  of the <STRONG>MEVENT</STRONG> structure members is not guaran-
       teed.  Additional fields may be added to the structure  in
       the future.

       Under  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG>,  these  calls  are  implemented  using
       either xterm's built-in mouse-tracking API  or  Alessandro
       Rubini's  gpm  server.   If  you are using something other
       than xterm there is no gpm daemon running on your machine,
       mouse  events  will not be visible to <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG> (and the
       <STRONG>wmousemask</STRONG> function will always return <STRONG>0</STRONG>).

       The z member in the event structure is not presently used.
       It  is  intended  for use with touch screens (which may be
       pressure-sensitive)   or   with   3D-mice/trackballs/power
       gloves.
       Mouse  events under xterm will not in fact be ignored dur-
       ing cooked mode, if they have been enabled by  <STRONG>wmousemask</STRONG>.
       Instead,  the  xterm  mouse report sequence will appear in
       the string read.

       Mouse events under xterm will not be detected correctly in
       a window with its keypad bit off.
