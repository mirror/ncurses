<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The function <STRONG>new_fieldtype</STRONG> creates a new field type usable
       for data validation.  You supply it  with  <EM>field</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>check</EM>,  a
       predicate  to check the validity of an entered data string
       whenever the user attempt to leave a field.  The (FIELD *)
       argument  is passed in so the validation predicate can see
       the field's buffer, sizes and other attributes; the second
       argument  is an argument-block structure, about which more
       below.

       You also supply <STRONG>new_fieldtype</STRONG> with <EM>char</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>check</EM>, a  function
       to  validate input characters as they are entered; it will
       be passed the character to be checked and a pointer to  an
       argument-block structure.

       The  function <STRONG>free_fieldtype</STRONG> frees the space allocated for
       a given validation type.

       The function <STRONG>set_fieldtype</STRONG> associates  three  storage-man-
       agement functions with a field type.  The <EM>mak</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>arg</EM> function
       is automatically applied to the list of arguments you give
       <STRONG>set_field_type</STRONG>  when  attaching validation to a field; its
       job is to bundle these into  an  allocated  argument-block
       object which can later be passed to validation predicated.
       The other two hook arguments should copy  and  free  argu-
       ment-block  structures.   They  will be used by the forms-
       driver code. You must supply  the  <EM>mak</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>arg</EM>  function,  the
       other  two  are optional, you may supply NULL for them. In
       this case it is assumed,  that  <EM>mak</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>arg</EM>  doesn't  allocate
       memory  but simply loads the argument into a single scalar
       value.

       form an ordered set, and provide the forms user with a way
       to  move  through the set.  The <STRONG>set_fieldtype_choice</STRONG> func-
       tion allows forms programmers to define successor and pre-
       decessor  functions  for  the field type.  These functions
       take the field pointer and an argument-block structure  as
       arguments.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       The pointer-valued routines return NULL on error.

       The  integer-valued  routines  return one of the following
       codes on error:

       <STRONG>E_OK</STRONG> The routine succeeded.

       <STRONG>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</STRONG>
            System error occurred (see <STRONG>errno</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</STRONG>
            Routine detected an incorrect or  out-of-range  argu-
            ment.

       <STRONG>E_CONNECTED</STRONG>
            The field is already connected to a form.

</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The header file <STRONG><form.h></STRONG> automatically includes the header
       file <STRONG><curses.h></STRONG>.

       All of the <STRONG>(char</STRONG> <STRONG>*)</STRONG> arguments of  these  functions  should
       actually  be <STRONG>(void</STRONG> <STRONG>*)</STRONG>.  The type has been left uncorrected
       for strict compatibility with System V.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These routines emulate the System V forms  library.   They
       were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
