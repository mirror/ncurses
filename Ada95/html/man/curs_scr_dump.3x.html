       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG><curses.h></STRONG>

       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>scr_dump(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*filename);</STRONG>
       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>scr_restore(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*filename);</STRONG>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG> routine dumps the  current  contents  of  the
       virtual screen to the file <EM>filename</EM>.

       The  <STRONG>scr_restore</STRONG>  routine  sets  the virtual screen to the
       contents of <EM>filename</EM>, which must have been  written  using
       <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG>.   The  next call to <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG> restores the screen
       to the way it looked in the dump file.

       The <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG> routine reads in the contents of <EM>filename</EM> and
       uses  them  to initialize the <STRONG>curses</STRONG> data structures about
       what the terminal currently has on  its  screen.   If  the
       data  is  determined  to  be  valid, <STRONG>curses</STRONG> bases its next
       update of the  screen  on  this  information  rather  than
       clearing  the  screen and starting from scratch.  <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG>
       is used after <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or  a  <STRONG>system</STRONG>  [see  <STRONG>system</STRONG>(BA_LIB)]
       call  to  share  the screen with another process which has
       done a <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG>  after  its  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  call.   The  data  is
       declared  invalid  if  the terminfo capabilities <STRONG>rmcup</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>nrrmc</STRONG> exist; also if the  terminal  has  been  written  to
       since the preceding <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG> call.

       The  <STRONG>scr_set</STRONG>  routine  is a combination of <STRONG>scr_restore</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG>.  It tells the program that  the  information  in
       <EM>filename</EM> is what is currently on the screen, and also what
       the program wants on the screen.  This can be  thought  of
       as a screen inheritance function.

       To  read (write) a window from (to) a file, use the <STRONG>getwin</STRONG>
       and <STRONG>putwin</STRONG> routines [see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">curs_util(3X)</A></STRONG>].


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       All routines return the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon  failure  and  <STRONG>OK</STRONG>
       upon success.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note  that  <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG>,  <STRONG>scr_set</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>scr_restore</STRONG>  may  be
       macros.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4,  describes  these  func-
       is also considered invalid "if the time-stamp of  the  tty
       is old" but don't define "old".
