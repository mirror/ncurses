<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  following  routines  give low-level access to various
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG> capabilities.  Theses routines typically  are  used
       inside library routines.

       The  <STRONG>def_prog_mode</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>def_shell_mode</STRONG>  routines save the
       current terminal modes as the  "program"  (in  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>)  or
       "shell"   (not   in   <STRONG>curses</STRONG>)   state   for   use  by  the
       <STRONG>reset_prog_mode</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset_shell_mode</STRONG>  routines.   This  is
       done  automatically  by  <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.   There is one such save
       area for each screen context allocated by <STRONG>newterm()</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>reset_prog_mode</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset_shell_mode</STRONG> routines  restore
       the  terminal  to "program" (in <STRONG>curses</STRONG>) or "shell" (out of
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG>) state.  These are  done  automatically  by  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>
       and,  after  an  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>, by <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG>, so they normally are
       not called.

       The <STRONG>resetty</STRONG> and <STRONG>savetty</STRONG>  routines  save  and  restore  the
       state  of  the  terminal modes.  <STRONG>savetty</STRONG> saves the current
       state in a buffer and <STRONG>resetty</STRONG> restores the state  to  what
       it was at the last call to <STRONG>savetty</STRONG>.

       The  <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> routine returns the current coordinates of the
       virtual screen cursor in <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM>.  If <STRONG>leaveok</STRONG> is currently
       <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>,  then <STRONG>-1</STRONG>,<STRONG>-1</STRONG> is returned.  If lines have been removed
       from the top of the screen,  using  <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>,  <EM>y</EM>  and  <EM>x</EM>
       include  these  lines;  therefore,  <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM> should be used
       only as arguments for <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG> routine sets the virtual screen cursor to <EM>y</EM>, <EM>x</EM>.
       If <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM> are both <STRONG>-1</STRONG>, then <STRONG>leaveok</STRONG> is set.  The two rou-
       tines <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> and <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG> are  designed  to  be  used  by  a
       cursor.   The  library  routine  would  call <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> at the
       beginning, do its manipulation of its own  windows,  do  a
       <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG>  on  its  windows, call <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG>, and then call
       <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG> routine provides access to the same  facil-
       ity  that  <STRONG>slk_init</STRONG>  [see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_slk.3x.html">curs_slk(3X)</A></STRONG>] uses to reduce the
       size of the screen.   <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>  must  be  called  before
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> is called.  If <EM>line</EM> is positive, a line
       is removed from the top of <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>; if <EM>line</EM> is negative,  a
       line is removed from the bottom.  When this is done inside
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>, the routine <STRONG>init</STRONG> (supplied by the user) is called
       with  two arguments: a window pointer to the one-line win-
       dow that has been allocated and an integer with the number
       of columns in the window.  Inside this initialization rou-
       tine, the integer variables <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>COLS</STRONG>  (defined  in
       <STRONG><curses.h></STRONG>) are not guaranteed to be accurate and <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>
       or <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG> must not be called.  It is allowable  to  call
       <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG> during the initialization routine.

       <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>  can  be called up to five times before calling
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG> routine sets  the  cursor  state  is  set  to
       invisible, normal, or very visible for <STRONG>visibility</STRONG> equal to
       <STRONG>0</STRONG>, <STRONG>1</STRONG>, or <STRONG>2</STRONG> respectively.  If  the  terminal  supports  the
       <EM>visibility</EM>   requested,   the  previous  <EM>cursor</EM>  state  is
       returned; otherwise, <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> is returned.

       The <STRONG>napms</STRONG> routine is used to sleep for <EM>ms</EM> milliseconds.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Except for <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG>,  these  routines  always  return  <STRONG>OK</STRONG>.
       <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG>  returns the previous cursor state, or <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if the
       requested <EM>visibility</EM> is not supported.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note that <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> is a macro, so <STRONG>&</STRONG> is not necessary  before
       the variables <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM>.

       Older  SVr4  man  pages  warn  that  the  return  value of
       <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG> "is currently  incorrect".   This  implementation
       gets  it  right, but it may be unwise to count on the cor-
       rectness of the return value anywhere else.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The functions <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG> and <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> are not described  in  the
       XSI  Curses standard, Issue 4.  All other functions are as
       described in XSI Curses.

       The SVr4 documentation describes <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG> and <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> as hav-
       ing  return  type  int.  This  is  misleading, as they are
