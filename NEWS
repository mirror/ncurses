This is a log of changes that ncurses has gone through since Zeyd
started working with Pavel Curtis' original work, pcurses, in 1992:

970515	4.1 release for upload to prep.ai.mit.edu
	+ re-tag changes since 970505 as 4.1 release.

970510
	+ modify ncurses 'g' test to allow mouse input
	+ modify default xterm description to include mouse.
	+ modify configure script to add -Wwrite-strings if gcc warnings are
	  enabled while configuring --enable-const (and fixed related warnings).
	+ add toggle, status display for keypad mode to ncurses 'g' test to
	  verify that keypad and scrollok are not inherited from parent window
	  during a call to newwin.
	+ correction to MKexpanded.sh to make it work when configure --srcdir is
	  used (reported by H.J.Lu).
	+ revise test for bool-type, ensuring that it checks if builtin.h is
	  available before including it, adding test for sizeof(bool) equal
	  to sizeof(short), and warning user if the size cannot be determined
	  (reported by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ add files to support configuration of ncurses as an add-on library
	  for GNU libc (patch by H.J.Lu <hjl@lucon.org>)

970506
	+ correct buffer overrun in lib_traceatr.c
	+ modify change to lib_vidattr.c to avoid redundant orig_pair.
	+ turn on 'echo()' in hanoi.c, since it is initially off.
	+ rename local 'errno' variable in etip.h to avoid conflict with global
	  (H.J.Lu).
	+ modify configure script to cache LD, AR, AR_OPTS (patch by H.J.Lu
	  <hjl@lucon.org>)

970505	4.1 pre-release
	+ regenerate the misc directory html dumps without the link list, which
	  is not useful.
	+ correct dependency in form directory makefile which caused unnecessary
	  recompiles.
	+ correct substitution for ABI_VERSION in test-makefile
	+ modify install rules for shared-library targets to remove the target
	  before installing, since some install programs do not properly handle
	  overwrite of symbolic links.
	+ change order of top-level targets so that 'include' immediate
	  precedes the 'ncurses' directory, reducing the time between new
	  headers and new libraries (requested by Larry Virden).
	+ modify lib_vidattr.c so that colors are turned off only before
	  modifying other attributes, turned on after others.  This makes the
	  hanoi.c program display correctly on FreeBSD console.
	+ modify debug code in panel library to print user-data addresses
	  rather than the strings which they (may) point to.
	+ add check to ensure that C++ binding and demo are not built with g++
	  versions below 2.7, since the binding uses templates.
	+ modify c++ binding and demo to build and run with SGI's c++ compiler. 
	  (It also compiles with the Sun SparcWorks compiler, but the demo does
	  not link, due to a vtbl problem).
	+ corrections to demo.cc, to fix out-of-scope variables (Juergen
	  Pfeifer).

970503
	+ correct memory leak in _nc_trace_buf().
	+ add configure test for regexpr.h, for Unixware 1.x.
	+ correct missing "./" prefixing names of generated files in ncurses
	  directory.
	+ use single-quotes in configure scripts assignments for MK_SHARED_LIB
	  to workaround shell bug on FreeBSD 2.1.5
	+ remove tabs from intermediate #define's for GCC_PRINTF, GCC_SCANF
	  that caused incorrect result in ncurses_cfg.h
	+ correct initialization in lib_trace.c, which omitted version info.
	+ remove ech, el1 attributes from cons25w description; they appear to
	  malfunction in FreeBSD 2.1.5
	+ correct color attributes in terminfo.src and lib_color.c to match
	  SVr4 behavior by interchanging codes 1,4, 3,6 in the setf/setb
	  capabilities.
	+ use curs_set() rather than checks via tigetstr() for test programs
	  that hide the cursor: firework, rain, worm.
	+ ensure that if the terminal lacks change_scroll_region, parm_index
	  and parm_rindex are used only to scroll the whole screen (patch by
	  Peter Wemm).
	+ correct curs_set() logic, which did not return ERR if the requested
	  attributes did not exist, nor did it assume an unknown initial state
	  for the cursor (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ combine IDcTransformLine and NoIDcTransformLine to new TransformLine
	  function in lib_doupdate.c (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ correct hashmap.c, which did not update index information (patch by
	  Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ patch by Juergen Pfeifer for C++ binding and demo (see c++/NEWS)
	+ correct index in lib_instr.c (Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ correct typo in 970426 patch from Tom's cleanup of lib_overlay.c
	  (Juergen Pfeifer).

970426
	+ corrected cost computation in PutRange(), which was using
	  milliseconds compared to characters by adding two new members to the
	  SCREEN struct, _hpa_ch_cost and _cup_ch_cost.
	+ drop ncurses/lib_unctrl.c, add ncurses/MKunctrl.awk to generate a
	  const array of strings (suggested by Alexander V. Lukyanov, though
	  with a perl script 970118).
	+ rewrote ncurses 'b' test to better exercise magic-cookie (xmc), as
	  well as noting the attributes that are not supported by a terminal.
	+ trace the computation of cost values in lib_mvcur.c
	+ modify _nc_visbuf() to use octal rather than hex, corrected sign
	  extension bug in that function that caused buffer overflow.
	+ modify trace in lib_acs.c to use _nc_visbuf().
	+ suppress trace within _traceattr2().
	+ correct logic of _tracechtype2(), which did not account for repeats
	  or redefinition within an acsc string.
	+ modify debug-library version baudrate() to use environment variable
	  $BAUDRATE to override speed computation.  This is needed for
	  regression testing.
	+ correct problems shown by "weblint -pedantic".
	+ update mailing-list information (now ncurses@bsdi.com).

970419
	+ Improve form_field_validation.3x manpage to better describe the
	  precision parameter for TYPE_NUMERIC and TYPE_INTEGER.  Provide more
	  precise information how the range checking can be avoided.  (patch by
	  Juergen Pfeifer, reported by Bryan Henderson)
	+ change type of min/max value of form types TYPE_INTEGER to long to
	  match SVr4 documentation.
	+ set the form window to stdscr in set_form_win() so that form_win()
	  won't return null (patch by Juergen Pfeifer, reported by Bryan
	  Henderson <bryanh@giraffe.netgate.net>).

970412
	+ corrected ifdef'ing of inline (from 970321) for TRACE vs C++.
	+ corrected toggle_attr_off() macro (patch by Andries.Brouwer).
	+ modify treatment of empty token in $MANPATH to /usr/man (reported by
	  <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>)
	+ modify traces that record functions-called so that chtype and attr_t
	  values are expressed symbolically, to simplify reuse of generated
	  test-scripts on SVr4 regression testing.
	+ add new trace functions _traceattr2() and _tracechtype2()

970405
	+ add configure option --enable-const, to support the use of 'const'
	  where XSI should have, but did not, specify.  This defines
	  NCURSES_CONST, which is an empty token otherwise, for strict
	  compatibility.
	+ make processing of configure options more verbose by echoing the
	  --enable/--with values.
	+ add configure option --enable-big-core
	+ set initial state of software echo off as per XSI.
	+ check for C++ builtin.h header
	+ correct computation of absolute-path for $INSTALL that dropped "-c"
	  parameter from the expression.
	+ rename config.h to ncurses_cfg.h to avoid naming-conflict when ncurses
	  is integrated into larger systems (from diffs by H.J.Lu for libc).
	+ correct inequality in lib_doupdate.c that caused a single-char to not
	  be updated when the char on the right-margin was not blank, idcok()
	  was true (patch by Alexander V.  Lukyanov 970124, also reported by
	  Kriang Lerdsuwanakij <lerdsuwa@scf-fs.usc.edu> 970329).
	+ modify 'clean' rule in include/Makefile so that files created by
	  configure script are removed in 'distclean' rule instead.

970328
	+ correct array limit in tparam_internal(), add case to interpret "%x"
	  (patch by Andreas Schwab)
	+ rewrote number-parsing in ncurses.c 'd' test; it did not reset the
	  value properly when non-numeric characters were given (reported by
	  Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>)

970321
	+ move definition of __INTERNAL_CAPS_VISIBLE before include for
	  progs.priv.h (patch by David MacKenzie).
	+ add configuration summary, reordered check for default include
	  directory to better accommodate a case where installer is configuring
	  a second copy of ncurses (reported by Klaus Weide
	  <kweide@tezcat.com>)
	+ moved the #define for 'inline' as an empty token from the
	  $(CFLAGS_DEBUG) symbol into config.h, to avoid redefinition warning
	  (reported by Ward Horner).
	+ modify test for bool builtin type to use 'unsigned' rather than
	  'unknown' when cross-compiling (reported by Ward Horner).

970315
	+ add header dependencies so that "make install.libs" will succeed
	  even if "make all" is not done first.
	+ moved some macros from lib_doupdate.c to curses.priv.h to use in
	  expanded functions with ATAC. 
	+ correct implementation of lib_instr.c; both XSI and SVr4 agree that
	  the winnstr functions can return more characters than will fit on one
	  line.

970308
	+ modify script that generates lib_gen.c to support traces of called &
	  return.
	+ add new configure option "--disable-macros", for testing calls within
	  lib_gen.c
	+ corrected logic that screens level-checking of called/return traces.

970301
	+ use new configure macro NC_SUBST to replace AC_PATH_PROG, better
	  addressing request by Ward Horner.
	+ check for cross-compiling before trying to invoke the autoconf
	  AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED macro (reported by Ward Horner)
	+ correct/simplify loop in _nc_visbuf(), 970201 changes omitted
	  a pointer-increment.
	+ eliminate obsolete symbol SHARED_ABI from dist.mk (noted by
	  Florian La Roche).

970215
	+ add configure option --enable-expanded, together with code that
	  implements an expanded form of certain complex macros, for testing
	  with ATAC.
	+ disable CHECK_POSITION unless --with-assertions is configured
	  (Alexander Lukyanov pointed out that this is redundant).
	+ use keyname() to show traced chtype values where applicable rather
	  than _tracechar(), which truncates the value to 8-bits.
	+ minor fixes to TRACE_ICALLS, added T_CREATE, TRACE_CCALLS macros.
	+ modify makefiles in progs and test directories to avoid using C
	  preprocessor options on link commands (reported by Ward Horner)
	+ correct ifdef/include-order for nc_alloc.h vs lib_freeall.c (reported
	  by Ward Horner)
	+ modify ifdef's to use configure-defined symbols consistently
	  (reported by Ward Horner)
	+ add/use new makefile symbols AR, AR_OPTS and LD to assist in non-UNIX
	  ports (reported by Ward Horner <whorner@tsi-telsys.com>)
	+ rename struct try to struct tries, to avoid name conflict with C++
	  (reported by Gary Johnson).
	+ modify worm.c to hide cursor while running.
	+ add -Wcast-qual to gcc warnings, fix accordingly.
	+ use PutChar rather than PutAttrChar in ClrToEOL to properly handle
	  wrapping (Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ correct spurious echoing of input in hanoi.c from eric's #291 & #292
	  patches (reported by Vernon C. Hoxie <vern@zebra.alphacdc.com>).
	+ extend IRIX configuration to IRIX64
	+ supply missing install.libs rule needed after restructuring
	  test/Makefile.in

970208
	+ modify "make mostlyclean" to leave automatically-generated source
	  in the ncurses directory, for use in cross-compiles.
	+ autogenerated object-dependencies for test directory
	+ add configure option --with-rcs-ids
	+ modify configuration scripts to generate major/minor/patch versions
	  (suggested by Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ supply missing va_end's in lib_scanw.c
	+ use stream I/O for trace-output, to eliminate fixed-size buffer
	+ add TRACE_ICALLS definition/support to lib_trace.c
	+ modify Ada95 binding to work with GNAT 3.09 (Juergen Pfeifer).

970201
	+ add/modify traces for called/return values to simplify extraction
	  for test scripts.
	+ changed _nc_visbuf to quote its result, and to dynamically allocate
	  the returned buffer.
	+ invoke ldconfig after installing shared library
	+ modify install so that overwrite applies to shared library -lcurses
	  in preference to static library (reported by Zeyd 960928).
	+ correct missing ';' in 961221 mod to overwrite option use of $(LN_S).
	+ fixes to allow "make install" to work without first doing a "make
	  all" (suggested by Larry Virden).

970125
	+ correct order of #ifdef for TABS_OK.
	+ instrumented toe.c to test memory-leaks.
	+ correct memory-deallocation in toe.c (patch by Jesse Thilo).
	+ include <sys/types.h> in configuration test for regex.h (patch by
	  Andreas Schwab)
	+ make infocmp recognize -I option, for SVr4 compatibility (reported by
	  Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>)

970118
	+ add extension 'use_default_colors()', modified test applications that
	  use default background (firework, gdc, hanoi, knight, worm) to
	  demonstrate.
	+ correct some limit checks in lib_doupdate.c exposed while running
	  worm.
	+ use typeCalloc macro for readability.
	+ add/use definition for CONST to accommodate testing with Solaris
	  (SVr4) curses, which doesn't use 'const' in its prototypes.
	+ modify ifdef's in test/hashtest.c and test/view.c to compile with
	  Solaris curses.
	+ modify _tracedump() to pad pad colors & attrs lines to match change
	  in 970101 showing first/last changes.
	+ corrected location of terminating null on dynamically allocated forms
	  fields (patch by Per Foreby).

970111
	+ added headers to make view.c compile on SCO with the resizeterm()
	  code (i.e., struct winsize) - though this compiles, I don't have a
	  suitable test configuration since SIGWINCH doesn't pass my network to
	  that machine - T.Dickey.
	+ update test/configure.in to supply some default substitutions.
	+ modify configure script to add -lncurses after -lgpm to fix problem
	  linking against static libraries.
	+ add a missing noraw() to test/ncurses.c (places noted by Jeremy
	  Buhler)
	+ add a missing wclear() to test/testcurs.c (patch by Jeremy Buhler
	  <jbuhler@cs.washington.edu>)
	+ modify headers to accommodate compilers that don't allow duplicate
	  "#define" lines for NCURSES_VERSION (reported by Larry W. Virden
	  <lvirden@cas.org>)
	+ fix formatting glitch in curs_getch.3x (patch by Jesse Thilo).
	+ modify lib_doupdate to make el, el1 and ed optimization use the
	  can_clear_with macro, and change EmitRange to allow leaving cursor at
	  the middle of interval, rather than always at the end (patch by
	  Alexander Lukyanov originally 960929, resync 970106).

970104
	+ workaround defect in autoconf 2.12 (which terminates configuration
	  if no C++ compiler is found) by adding an option --without-cxx.
	+ modify several man-pages to use tbl, where .nf/.fi was used (reported
	  by Jesse Thilo).
	+ correct font-codes in some man-pages (patch by Jesse Thilo
	  <Jesse.Thilo@pobox.com>)
	+ use configure script's knowledge of existence of g++ library for the
	  c++ Makefile (reported by Paul Jackson).
	+ correct misleading description of --datadir configuration option
	  (reported by Paul Jackson <pj@sam.engr.sgi.com>)

970101
	+ several corrections to _nc_mvcur_scrolln(), prompted by a bug report
	  from Peter Wemm:
	> the logic for non_dest_scroll_region was interchanged between the
	  forward & reverse scrolling cases.
	> multiple returns from the function allowed certain conditions to do
	  part of an operation before discovering that it couldn't be
	  completed, returning an error without restoring the cursor.
	> some returns were ERR, where the function had completed the
	  operation, because the insert/delete line logic was improperly
	  tested (this was probably the case Peter saw).
	> contrary to comments, some scrolling cases were tested after the
	  insert/delete line method.
	+ modify _tracedump() to show first/last changes.
	+ modify param of ClrUpdate() in lib_doupdate.c to 'curscr', fixes
	  refresh problem (reported by Peter Wemm) that caused nvi to not show
	  result of ":r !ls" until a ^L was typed.

961229	(internal alpha)
	+ correct some of the writable-strings warnings (reported by Gary
	  Johnson <gjohnson@season.com>).  Note that most of the remaining ones
	  are part of the XSI specification, and can't be "fixed".
	+ improve include-dependencies in form, menu, panel directories.
	+ correct logic of delay_output(), which would return early if
	  there is data on stdin.
	+ modify interface & logic of _nc_timed_wait() to support 2 file
	  descriptors, needed for GPM.
	+ integrate patch by Andrew Kuchling <amk@magnet.com> for GPM (mouse)
	  support, correcting logic in wgetch() and _nc_mouse_parse() which
	  prevented patch from working properly.
	+ improve performance of panel algorithm (Juergen Pfeifer 961203).
	+ strip RCS id's from generated .html files in Ada95 subtree.
	+ resync with generated .html files (Juergen Pfeifer 961223).
	+ terminfo.src 10.1.0 from Eric.

961224	4.0 release
	+ release as 4.0 to accommodate Linux ld.so.1.8.5
	+ correct syntax/spelling, regenerated .doc files from .html using
	  lynx 2.5
	+ refined forms/menus makefiles (Juergen Pfeifer 961223).

961221	- snapshot
	+ remove logic in read_entry.c that attempts to refine errno by using
	  'access()' for the directory (from patch by Florian La Roche).
	+ correct configure test/substitution that inhibits generating
	  include-path to /usr/include if gcc is used (reported by Florian La
	  Roche).
	+ modify setupterm() to allocate new TERMINAL for each call, just as
	  solaris' curses does (Alexander Lukyanov 960829).
	+ corrected memory leaks in read_entry.c
	+ add configure options --with-dbmalloc, --with-dmalloc, and
	  --disable-leaks, tested by instrumenting infocmp, ncurses programs.
	+ move #include's for stdlib.h and string.h to *.priv.h to accommodate
	  use of dbmalloc.
	+ modify use of $(LN_S) to follow recommendation in autoconf 2.12,
	  i.e., set current directory before linking.
	+ split-out panel.priv.h, improve dependencies for forms, menus
	  (Juergen Pfeifer 961204).
	+ modify _nc_freewin() to reset globals curscr/newscr/stdscr when
	  freeing the corresponding WINDOW (Purify).
	+ modify delwin() to return ERR if the window to be deleted has
	  subwindows, needed as a side-effect of resizeterm() (Purify).  Tested
	  and found that SVr4 curses behaves this way.
	+ implement logic for _nc_freeall(), bringing stub up to date.

961215
	+ modify wbkgd() so that it doesn't set nulls in the rendered text,
	  even if its argument doesn't specify a character (fixes test case by
	  Juergen Pfeifer for bug-report).
	+ set window-attributes in wbkgd(), to simplify comparison against
	  Solaris curses, which does this.

961214	- snapshot
	+ replace most constants in ncurses 'o' test by expressions, making it
	  work with wider range of screen sizes.
	+ add options to ncurses.c to specify 'e' test softkey format, and the
	  number of header/footer lines to rip-off.
	+ add ^R (repaint after resize), ^L (refresh) commands to ncurses 'p'
	  test.
	+ add shell-out (!) command to ncurses 'p' test to allow test of
	  resize between endwin/refresh.
	+ correct line-wrap case in mvcur() by emitting carriage return,
	  overlooked in 960928, but needed due to SVr4 compatibility changes to
	  terminal modes in 960907.
	+ correct logic in wresize that causes new lines to be allocated,
	  broken for the special case of increasing rows only in 960907's fix
	  for subwindows.
	+ modify configure script to generate $(LDFLAGS) with -L and -l options
	  in preference to explicit library filenames.  (NOTE: this may
	  require further amending, since I vaguely recall a dynamic loader
	  that did not work properly without the full names, but it should be
	  handled as an exception to the rule, since some linkers do bulk
	  inclusion of libraries when given the full name - T.Dickey).
	+ modify configure script to allow user-supplied $CFLAGS to set the
	  debug-option in all libraries (requested by lots of people).
	+ use return consistently from main(), rather than exit (reported by
	  Florian La Roche).
	+ add --enable-getcap-cache option to configure, normally disabled
	  (requested by Florian La Roche).
	+ make configure test for gettimeofday() and possibly -lbsd more
	  efficient (requested by Florian La Roche florian@knorke.saar.de)
	+ minor adjustments to Ada95 binding (patches by Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ correct attributes after emitting orig_pair in lib_vidattr.c (patch
	  by lav@yars.free.net).

961208
	+ corrected README wrt Ada95 (Juergen Pfeifer)

961207	- snapshot
	+ integrate resizeterm() into doupdate(), so that if screen size
	  changes between endwin/refresh, ncurses will resize windows to fit
	  (this needs additional testing with pads and softkeys).
	+ add, for memory-leak testing, _nc_freeall() entrypoint to free all
	  data used in ncurses library.
	+ initialize _nc_idcok, _nc_idlok statically to resolve discrepancy
	  between initscr() and newwin() initialization (reported by
	  lav@yars.free.net).
	+ test built VERSION=4.0, SHARED_ABI=4 with Linux ld.so.1.8.5
	  (set beta versions to those values -- NOTE that subsequent pre-4.0
	  beta may not be interchangeable).
	+ modify configure script to work with autoconf 2.12

961130	1.9.9g release
	+ add copyright notices to configuration scripts (written by Thomas
	  Dickey).

961127
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer (mostly for panel):
	+ cosmetic improvement for a few routines in the ncurses core library
	  to avoid warning messages.
	+ the panel overlap detection was broken
	+ the panel_window() function was not fool-proof.
	+ Some inlining...
	+ Cosmetic changes (also to avoid warning messages when compiling with
	  -DTRACE).

961126
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ eliminates warning messages for the compile of libform.
	+ inserts Per Foreby's new field type TYPE_IPV4 into libform.
	+ Updates man page and the Ada95 binding to reflect this.
	+ Improves inlining in libmenu and libform.

961120
	+ improve the use of the "const" qualifier in the
	  panel library (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ change set_panel_userptr() and panel_userptr() to use void*
	  (Juergen Pfeifer)

961119
	+ change ABI to 3.4
	+ package with 961119 version of Ada95 binding (fixes for gnat-3.07).
	  (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ correct initialization of the stdscr pseudo panel in panel library
	  (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ use MODULE_ID (rcs keywords) in forms and menus libraries (Juergen
	  Pfeifer).
	> patch #324 by Eric.
	+ typo in curs_termcap man page (reported by Hendrik Reichel
	  <106065.2344@compuserve.com>)
	+ change default xterm entry to xterm-r6.
	+ add entry for color_xterm

961116	- snapshot
	+ lint found several functions that had only #define implementations
	  (e.g., attr_off), modified curses.h.in to generate them as per XSI
	  Curses requirement that every macro be available as a function.
	+ add check in infocmp.c to guard against string compare of
	  CANCELLED_STRING values.
	+ modify firework.c, rain.c to hide cursor while running.
	+ correct missing va_end in lib_tparm.c
	+ modify hanoi.c to work on non-color terminals, and to use timing
	  delays when in autoplay mode.
	+ correct 'echochar()' to refresh immediately (reported by Adrian
	  Garside 94ajg2@eng.cam.ac.uk)
	> patch #322 by eric:
	+ reorganize terminfo.src entries for xterm.

961109	- snapshot
	+ corrected error in line-breakout logic (lib_doupdate.c)
	+ modified newdemo to use wgetch(win) rather than getch() to eliminate
	  a spurious clear-screen.
	+ corrected ifdef's for 'poll()' configuration.
	+ added modules to ncurses, form, menu for Ada95 binding (Juergen
	  Pfeifer).
	+ modify set_field_buffer() to allow assignment of string longer than
	  the initial buffer length, and to return the complete string rather
	  than only the initial size (Juergen Pfeifer and Per Foreby
	  <perf@efd.lth.se>).

961102	- snapshot
	+ configure for 'poll()' in preference to 'select()', since older
	  systems are more likely to have a broken 'select()'.
	+ modified render_char() to avoid OR'ing colors.
	+ minor fixes to testcurs.c, newdemo.c test programs: ifdef'd out the
	  resize test, use wbkgd and corrected box() parameters.
	+ make flushinp() test work in ncurses.c by using napms() instead of
	  sleep().
	+ undo Eric's changes to xterm-x11r6 (it no longer matched the X11R6.1
	  distribution, as stated)
	+ terminfo 9.13.18 (resync by Eric)

	  Marshall).

961026	- snapshot
	+ reset flags in 'getwin()' that might cause refresh to attempt to
	  manipulate the non-existent parent of a window that is read from a
	  file (lib_screen.c).
	+ restructure _nc_timed_wait() to log more information, and to try to
	  recover from badly-behaved 'select()' calls (still testing this).
	+ move define for GOOD_SELECT into configure script.
	+ corrected extra '\' character inserted before ',' in comp_scan.c
	+ corrected expansion of %-format characters in dump_entry.c; some were
	  rendered as octal constants.
	+ modify dump_entry.c to make terminfo output more readable and like
	  SVr4, by using "\s" for spaces (leading/trailing only), "\," for
	  comma, "\^" and "\:" as well.
	+ corrected some memory leaks in ncurses.c, and a minor logic error
	  in the top-level command-parser.
	+ correction for label format 4 (PC style with info line), a
	  slk_clear(), slk_restore() sequence didn't redraw the info line
	  (Juergen Pfeifer).

	+ correct ifdef's for c++ in curses.h
	+ change default xterm type to xterm-x11r6.
	+ correct quoting in configure that made man-pages installed with

	+ add graphic characters to vt52 description.
	+ use PutAttrChar in ClrToEOL to ensure proper background, position.
	+ simplify/correct logic in 'mvcur()' that does wrapping; it was
	  updating the position w/o actually moving the cursor, which broke
	  relative moves.
	+ ensure that 'doupdate()' sets the .oldindex values back to a sane
	  state; this was causing a spurious refresh in ncurses 'r'.
	+ add logic to configure (from vile) to guard against builders who
	  don't remove config.cache & config.status when doing new builds.
	+ corrected logic for 'repeat_char' in EmitRange (from #317), which
	  did not follow the 2-parameter scheme specified in XSI.

	  either ;-)
	+ clarify the documentation for the builtin form fieldtypes (Juergen
	  Pfeifer)
	> patch 314 by eric:
	+ Enhancement suggested by A. Lukyanov -- reset scroll region on
	  startup rather than at wrapup time.
	+ Fix suggested by A. Lukyanov, make storage of palette tables
	  and their size counts per-screen for multi-terminal applications.
	+ Improved error reporting for infotocap translation errors.
	+ Update terminfo.src to 9.13.14.

960907	- snapshot
	+ rewrote wgetstr to make it erase control chars and also fix bogus use
	  of _nc_outstr which caused the display to not wrap properly (display
	  problem reported by John M. Flinchbaugh <glynis@netrax.net>)
	+ modify ncurses 'f' test to accommodate terminal responses to C1 codes
	  (and split up this screen to accommodate non-ANSI terminals).
	+ test enter_insert_mode and exit_insert_mode in has_ic().

	+ corrected wbkgdset macro (XSI allows background character to be null),
	  and tests that use it.
	+ more corrections to terminfo (xterm & rxvt)
	+ undid change to mcprint prototype (cannot use size_t in curses.h
	  because not all systems declare it in the headers that we can safely

	  than function keys in 'g' test.
	+ corrected misplaced wclrtoeol calls in addch to accommodate wrapping
	  (reported by Philippe De Muyter).
	+ modify lib_doupdate.c to use effective costs to tradeoff between
	  delete-character/insert-character vs normal updating (reported by
	  David MacKenzie).
	+ compute effective costs for screen update operations (e.g., clr_eos,
	  delete_character).
	+ corrected error in knight.c exposed by wrap fixes in 960622; the

	+ added -s option to tic, to provide better diagnostics in run_tic.sh
	+ improved error-recovery for tabset install.
	+ change ABI to 3.1 (dropped tparam, corrected getbkgd(), added
	  _yoffset to WINDOW).

960617
	+ corrected two logic errors in read_entry.c, write_entry.c (called by
	  tic, the write/read of terminfo entries used inconsistent rules for
	  locating the entries; the $TERMINFO_DIRS code would find only the
	  first entry in a list).
	+ refined pathname computation in run_tic.sh and shlib.
	+ corrected initialization of $IP in misc/run_tic.sh

960615	- snapshot

	  warnings turned on, which makes config.log hard to read.
	+ added 'lint' rule to top-level Makefile.
	+ added configure option '--with-install-prefix' for use by system
	  builders to install into staging locations (from request by
	  charles@comm.polymtl.ca)
	+ corrected autoconfigure for Debian man program; it's not installed
	  as "man_db".
	+ set noecho in 'worm'; it was ifdef'd for debug only
	+ updated test/configure.in for timing-display in ncurses 'p' test
	+ corrected misspelled 'getbkgd()'.
	+ corrected wbkgdset to work like observed syvr4 (sets A_CHARTEXT part
	  to blank if no character given, copies attributes to window's
	  attributes).
	+ modified lib_doupdate.c to use lower-level SP's current_attr state
	  instead of curscr's state, since it is redundant.
	+ correction to IDcTransformLine logic which controls where InsStr is
	  invoked (refined by lav@yars.free.net).

### ncurses-1.9.8a -> 1.9.9e

* fixed broken wsyncup()/wysncdown(), as a result wnoutrefresh() now has
  copy-changed-lines behavior.
* added and documented wresize() function.
* more fixes to LOWER-RIGHT corner handling.
* changed the line-breakout optimization code to allow some lines to be
  emitted before the first check.
* added option for tic to use symbolic instead of hard links (for AFS)
* fix to restore auto-wrap mode.
* trace level can be controlled by environment variable.
* better handling of NULs in terminal descriptions.
* improved compatibility with observed SVR4 behavior.
* the refresh behavior of over-lapping windows is now more efficient and
  behaves like SVR4.
* use autoconf 2.7, which results in a working setup for SCO 5.0.
* support for ESCDELAY.
* small fixes for menu/form code.
* the test directory has its own configure.
* fixes to pads when optimizing scrolling.
* fixed several off-by-one bugs.
* fixes for termcap->terminfo translation; less restrictions more correct
  behavior.

### ncurses-1.9.7 -> 1.9.8a

* teach infocmp -i to recognize ECMA highlight sequences
* infocmp now dumps all SVr4 termcaps (not just the SVr4 ones) on -C
* support infocmp -RBSD.
* satisfy XSI Curses requirement that every macro be available as a function.
* This represents the last big change to the public interface of ncurses. The
  ABI_VERSION has now been set at 3.0 and should stay there barring any great
  catastrophies or acts of God.
* The C++ has been cleaned up in reaction to the changes to satisfy XSI's
  requirements.
* libncurses now gets linked to libcurses to help seamless emulation
  (replacement) of a vendor's curses. --disable-overwrite turns this behavior
  off.

### ncurses-1.9.6 -> 1.9.7

* corrected return values of setupterm()
* Fixed some bugs in tput (it does padding now)
* fixed a bug in tic that made it do the wrong thing on entries with more than
  one `use' capability.
* corrected the screen-size calculation at startup time to alter the
  numeric capabilities as per SVr4, not just LINES and COLS.
* toe(1) introduced; does what infocmp -T used to.
* tic(1) can now translate AIX box1 and font[0123] capabilities.
* tic uses much less core, the dotic.sh kluge can go away now.
* fix read_entry() and write_entry() to pass through cancelled capabilities OK.
* Add $HOME/.terminfo as source/target directory for terminfo entries.
* termcap compilation now automatically dumps an entry to $HOME/.terminfo.
* added -h option to toe(1).
* added -R option to tic(1) and infocmp(1).
* added fallback-entry-list feature.
* added -i option to infocmp(1).
* do a better job at detecting if we're on SCO.

### ncurses-1.9.5 -> 1.9.6

* handling of TERMCAP environment variables now works correctly.
* various changes to shorten termcap translations to less that 1024 chars.
* tset(1) added
* mouse support for xterm.
* most data tables are now const and accordingly live in shareable text space.
* Obey the XPG4/SVr4 practice that echo() is initally off.
* tic is much better at translating XENIX and AIX termcap entries now.
* tic can interpret ko capabilities now.
* integrated Juergen Pfeifer's forms library.
* taught write_entry() how not to write more than it needs to; this change
  reduces the size of the terminfo tree by a full 26%!
* infocmp -T option added.
* better warnings about historical tic quirks from tic.

### ncurses 1.9.4 -> 1.9.5

* menus library is now included with documentation.
* lib_mvcur has been carefully profiled and tuned.
* Fixed a ^Z-handling bug that was tanking lynx(1).
* HJ Lu's patches for ELF shared libraries under Linux
* terminfo.src 9.8.2
* tweaks for compiling in seperate directories.
* Thomas Dickey's patches to support NeXT's brain-dead linker
* Eric Raymond's patches to fix problems with long termcap entries.
* more support for shared libraries under SunOS and IRIX.

### ncurses 1.9.3 -> 1.9.4

* fixed an undefined-order-of-evaluation bug in lib_acs.c
* systematically gave non-API public functions and data an _nc_ prefix.
* integrated Juergen Pfeifer's menu code into the distribution.
* totally rewrote the knight test game's interface

### ncurses 1.9.2c -> 1.9.3

* fixed the TERMCAP_FILE Support.
* fixed off-by-one errors in scrolling code
* added tracemunch to the test tools
* took steps to cut the running time of make install.data

### ncurses 1.9.2c -> 1.9.2d

* revised 'configure' script to produce libraries for normal, debug,
  profile and shared object models.

### ncurses 1.9.1 -> 1.9.2

* use 'autoconf' to implement 'configure' script.
* panels support added
* tic now checks for excessively long termcap entries when doing translation
* first cut at eliminating namespace pollution.

### ncurses 1.8.9 -> 1.9

* cleanup gcc warnings for the following: use size_t where 'int' is not
  appropriate, fixed some shadowed variables, change attr_t to compatible with
  chtype, use attr_t in some places where it was confused with 'int'.
* use chtype/attr_t casts as appropriate to ensure portability of masking
  operations.
* added-back waddchnstr() to lib_addstr.c (it had been deleted).
* supplied missing prototypes in curses.h
* include <termcap.h> in lib_termcap.c to ensure that the prototypes
  are consistent (they weren't).
* corrected prototype of tputs in <termcap.h>
* rewrote varargs parsing in lib_tparm.c (to avoid referencing memory
  that may be out of bounds on the stack) -- Purify found this.
* ensure that TRACE is defined in lib_trace.c (to solve prototype
  warnings from gcc).
* corrected scrolling-region size in 'mvcur_wrap()'
* more spelling fixes
* use 'calloc()' to allocate WINDOW struct in lib_newwin.c (Purify).
* set default value for SP->_ofp in lib_set_term.c (otherwise SunOS dumps
  core in init_acs()).
* include <errno.h> in write_entry.c (most "braindead" includes declare errno
  in that file).

### ncurses 1.8.8 -> 1.8.9

* compile (mostly) clean with gcc 2.5.8 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
  -Wmissing-prototypes -Wconversion and using __attribute__ to flush out
  non-portable use of "%x" for pointers, or for chtype data (which is declared
  as a long).
* modified doupdate to ensure that typahead was turned on before attempting
  select-call (otherwise, some implementations hang).
* added trace mask TRACE_FIFO, use this in lib_getch.c to allow finer
  resolution of traces.
* improved bounds checking on several critical functions.
* the data directory has been replaced by the new master terminfo file.
* -F file-comparison option added to infocmp.
* compatibility with XSI Curses is now documented in the man bages.
* wsyncup/wsyncdown functions are reliable now; subwindow code in general
  is much less flaky.
* capabilities ~msgr, tilde_glitch, insert_padding, generic_type, no_pad_char,
  memory_above, memory_below, and hard_copy are now used properly.
* cursor-movement optimization has been completely rewritten.
* vertical-movement optimization now uses hardware scrolling, il, dl.

### ncurses 1.8.7 -> 1.8.8
* untic no longer exists, infocmp replaces it.
* tic can understand termcap now, especially if it is called captoinfo.
* The Linux Standard Console terminfo entry is called linux insead of console.
  It also uses the kernel's new method of changing charsets.
* initscr() will EXIT upon error (as the docs say) This wil mostly happen if
  you try to run on an undefined terminal.
* I can get things running on AIX but tic can't compile terminfo. I have to
  compile entries on another machine. Volunteers to hunt this bug are welcome.
* wbkgd() and wbkgdset() can be used to set a windows background to color.
  wclear()/werase() DO NOT use the current attribute to clear the screen.
  This is the way SVR4 curses works. PDCurses 2.1 is broken in this respect,
  though PDCurses 2.2 has been fixed.
* cleaned up the test/ directory.
* test/worm will segfault after quite a while.
* many spelling corrections courtesy of Thomas E. Dickey

### ncurses 1.8.6 -> 1.8.7
* cleaned up programs in test/ directory.
* fixed wbkgdset() macro.
* modified getstr() to stop it from advancing cursor in noecho mode.
* modified linux terminfo entry to work with the latest kernel to get
  the correct alternate character set.
* also added a linux-mono entry for those running on monochrome screens.
* changed initscr() so that it behaves like the man page says it does.
  this fixes the problem with programs in test/ crashing with SIGSEV if
  a terminal is undefined.
* modified addch() to avoid using any term.h #define's
* removed duplicate tgoto() in lib_tparm.c
* modified dump_entry.c so that infocmp deals correctly with ',' in acsc
* modified delwin() to correctly handle deleting subwindows.
* fixed Makefile.dist to stop installing an empty curses.h
* fixed a couple of out-of-date notes in man pages.

### ncurses 1.8.5 -> 1.8.6
* Implemented wbkgd(), bkgd(), bkgdset(), and wbkgdset().
* The handling of attributes has been improved and now does not turn off color
  if other attributes are turned off.
* scrolling code is improved. Scrolling in subwindows is still broken.
* Fixes to several bugs that manifest them on platforms other than Linux.
* The default to meta now depends on the status of the terminal when ncurses
  is started.
* The interface to the tracing facility has changed.  Instead of the pair of
  functions traceon() and traceoff(), there is just one function trace() which
  takes a trace mask argument.  The trace masks, defined in curses.h, are
  as follows:

	#define TRACE_DISABLE	0x00	/* turn off tracing */
	#define TRACE_ORDINARY	0x01	/* ordinary trace mode */
	#define TRACE_CHARPUT	0x02	/* also trace all character outputs */
	#define TRACE_MAXIMUM	0x0f	/* maximum trace level */

  More trace masks may be added, or these may be changed, in future releases.
* The pad code has been improved and the pad test code in test/ncurses.c has
  been improved.
* The prototype ansi entry has been changed to work with a wider variety
  of emulators.
* Fix to the prototype ansi entry that enables it to work with PC emulators
  that treat trailing ";m" in a highlight sequence as ";0m"; this doesn't
  break operation with any emulators.
* There are now working infocmp, captoinfo, tput, and tclear utilities.
* tic can now compile entries in termcap syntax.
* Core-dump bug in pnoutrefresh fixed.
* We now recognize and compile all the nonstandard capabilities in Ross
  Ridge's mytinfo package (rendering it obsolete).
* General cleanup and documentation improvements.
* Fixes and additions to the installation-documentation files.
* Take cursor to normal mode on endwin.

### ncurses 1.8.4 -> 1.8.5
* serious bugs in updating screen which caused erratic non-display,
  fixed.
* fixed initialization for getch() related variable which cause
  unpredictable results.
* fixed another doupdate bug which only appeared if you have
  parm_char.
* implemented redrawln() and redrawwin().
* implemented winsnstr() and related functions.
* cleaned up insertln() and deleteln() and implemented (w)insdeln().
* changed Makefile.dist so that installation of man pages will
  take note of the terminfo directory.
* fixed Configure (removed the mysterious 'X').
* Eric S. Raymond fixed the script.* files so that they work with
  stock awk.

#### ncurses 1.8.3 -> 1.8.4 #### ####
* fixed bug in refreshing the screen after return from shell_mode.
  There are still problems but they don't manifest themselves on
  my machine (Linux 0.99.14f).
* added wgetnstr() and modified things accordingly.
* fixed the script.src script.test to work with awk not just gawk.
* Configure can now take an argument of the target system.
* added test/ncurses.c which replaces several other programs and
  performs more testing.
[Thanks to Eric S Raymond for the last 4]
* more fixes to lib_overlay.c and added test/over.c to illustrate
  how it works.
* fixed ungetch() to take int instead of ch.
* fixes to cure wgetch() if flushinp() is called.

One note I forgot to mention in 1.8.3 is that tracing is off by
default starting in the version. If you want tracing output, put
traceon(); in your code and link with -ldcurses.

#### ncurses 1.8.2 -> ncurses 1.8.3 #### ####
MAJOR CHANGES:
1) The order of capabilities has been changed in order to achieve
binary compatibility with SVR4 terminfo database. This has the
unfortunate effect of breaking application currently linked with
ncurses. To ensure correct behavior, recompile all such programs.
Most programs using color or newer capabilities will break, others
will probably continue to work ok.

2) Pavel Curtis has renounced his copyright to the public domain.
This means that his original sources (posted to comp.sources.unix,
volume 1) are now in the public domain.  The current sources are
NOT in the public domain, they are copyrighted by me.  I'm
entertaining ideas on what the new terms ncurses is released under.

3) Eric S. Raymond has supplied a complete set of man pages for
ncurses in ?roff format. They will eventually replace most of the
current docs. Both sets are included in this release.

Other changes and notes from 1.8.2 include:
* SIGSEGV during scrolling no longer occurs.
* Other problems with scrolling and use of idl have been corrected.
* lib_getch.c has been re-written and should perform flawlessly.
  please use test/getch.c and any other programs to test this.
* ripoffline() is implemented (Thanks to Eric) and slk_ functions
  changed accordingly.
* I've added support for terminals that scroll if you write in the
  bottom-right corner.
* fixed more bugs in pads code. If anybody has a program that uses
  pads I'd love a copy.
* correct handling for terminal with back_color_erase capability
  (such as Linux console, and most PC terminals)
* ^Z handling apparently didn't work (I should never trust code
  sent me to me without extensive testing). It now seems to be
  fixed. Let me know if you have problems.
* I've added support for Apollo and NeXT, but it may still be
  incomplete, especially when dealing with the lack of POSIX
  features.
* scrolling should be more efficient on terminals with idl
  capabilities. Please see src/lib_scroll.c for more notes.
* The line drawing routines were offset by 1 at both ends. This
  is now fixed.
* added a few missing prototypes and macros (e.g. setterm())
* fixed code in src/lib_overlay.c which used to crash.
* added a few more programs in test/ The ones from the PDCurses
  package are useful, especially if you have SVR4 proper. I'm
  interested in the results you get on such a systems (Eric? ;-).
  They already exposed certain bugs in ncurses.
* See src/README for porting notes.
* The C++ code should really replace ncurses.h instead of working
  around it. It should avoid name-space clashes with nterm.h (use
  rows instead of lines, etc.)
* The C++ should compile ok. I've added explicit rules to the
  Makefile because no C++ defaults are documented on the suns.
* The docs say that echo() and nocbreak() are mutually exclusive.
  At the moment ncurses will switch to cbreak() if the case above
  occurs. Should it continue to do so? How about echo() and noraw()?
* PDCurses seem to assume that wclear() will use current attribute
  when clearing the screen. According to Eric this is not the case
  with SVR4.
* I have discovered, to my chagrin, SunOS 4.x (and probably other systems)
  * doesn't have vsscanf and God knows what else!  I've will do a vsscanf().
* I've also found out that the src/script.* rely on gawk and will not
  work with stock awk or even with nawk. Any changes are welcome.
* Linux is more tolerant of NULL dereferences than most systems. This
  fact was exposed by hanoi.
* ncurses still seems inefficient in drawing the screen on a serial
  link between Linux and suns. The padding may be the culprit.
* There seems to be one lingering problem with doupdate() after shelling
  out. Despite the fact the it is sending out the correct information
  to the terminal, nothing takes effect until you press ^L or another
  refresh takes place. And yes, output does get flushed.

#### ncurses 1.8.1 -> ncurses 1.8.2 #### Nov 28, 1993 ####

* added support for SVR4 and BSDI's BSD/386.
* major update and fix to scrolling routine.
* MORE fixes to stuff in lib_getch.c.
* cleaned-up configuration options and can now generate
	Config.* files through an awk script.
* changed setupterm() so it can be called more than once,
	add added set_curterm(), del_curterm().

* a couple of bug fixes.
* a few code cleanups.

#### ncurses 0.7.2/0.7.3 -> ncurses 1.8 #### Aug 31, 1993 ####

* The annoying message "can't open file." was due to missing
  terminfo entry for the used terminal. It has now been
  replaced by a hopefully more helpful message.
* Problems with running on serial lines are now fixed.
* Added configuration files for SunOS, Linux, HP/UX, Ultrix,
  386bsd/BSDI (if you have others send'em to me)
* Cleaner Makefile.
* The documentation in manual.doc is now more uptodate.
* update optimization and support for hp terminals, and 386bsd
  console driver(s).
* mvcur optimization for terminals without cursor addressing
  (doesn't work on Linux)
* if cursor moved since last update, getch() will refresh the
  screen before working.
* getch() & alarm() can now live together. in 0.7.3 a signal
  interrupted getch() (bug or feature?) now the getch is
  restarted.
* scanw() et all were sick, now fixed.
* support for 8-bit input (use meta()).
* added default screen size to all terminfos.
* added c++ Ncursesw class.
* several minor bug fixes.

#### ncurses 0.7.2 -> ncurses 0.7.3 #### May 27, 1993 ####

* Config file to cope with different platforms (386BSD, BSDI, Ultrix, SunOS)
* more fixes to lib_getch.c
* changes related to Config

#### ncurses 0.7 -> ncurses 0.7.2 #### May 22, 1993 ####

* docs updated slightly (color usage is now documented).
* yet another fix for getch(), this one fixes problems with ESC being swallowed
  if another character is typed before the 1 second timeout.
* Hopefully, addstr() and addch() are 8-bit clean.
* fixed lib_tparm.c to use stdarg.h (should run on suns now)
* order of capabilities changed to reflect that specified in SYSV
  this will allow for binary-compatibility with existing terminfo dbs.
* added halfdelay()
* fixed problems with asc_init()
* added A_PROTECT and A_INVIS
* cleaned up vidputs()
* general cleanup of the code
* more attention to portability to other systems
* added terminfos for hp70092 (wont work until changes to lib_update.c are
  made) and 386BSD pcvt drivers.

Thanks to Hellmuth Michaelis for his help.
optimization code is slated for the next major release, stay tuned!

#### ncurses 0.6/0.61 -> ncurses 0.7 #### April 1, 1993
Please note that the next release will be called 1.8. If you want to know about
the rationale drop me a line.
